# Sequencing
Sequencing refers to the order a computer will execute commands. This is important because if a computer doesn't do this it will give results we weren't expecting.

An example for recording a TV program:
```
SET time_to_record = 15:00
SET channel_to_record = Channel 4

CHECK current_time
IF current_time = time_to_record THEN RECORD channel_to_record
```

The way a program interprets the commands is by the programming languages [[Syntax|syntax]].
