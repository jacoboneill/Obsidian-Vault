# Object-Oriented Programming
Object oriented programming, unlike procedural programming, is modelled based on real-world relationships.

For example, A bank, Customers, and Financial Information. In a banking application there would be a Bank object, with many customer objects and many financial information objects in the customers.

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is good for collaboration with other developers as:
- The program is split into modules with interfaces, allowing for easier adaptation.
- Easier to develop new features by creating new object.
- The modularity allows groups of developers to split the work into individual module.
- Allows for reusability via inheritance.
