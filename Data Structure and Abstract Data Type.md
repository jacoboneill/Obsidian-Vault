# Data Structure and Abstract Data Type
> [!definition]
> A data structure is any method used to store data in an organised and accessible format.

Data structures normally contain data that are related and organised in such a way that a program can manipulate them.

For example, a text file may be suitable for a database whereas a stack is suitable for handling exceptions.
