# Storing Data
- Data is stored in memory addresses

# Naming
- Naming conventions should be used for readability

# Example
```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	int number1 = 2;
	int number2 = 1;
	int result = number1 + number2;
}
```

| Memory Address | 1000 | 1001 | 1010 |
|-|-|-|-|
| Variable | number1 | number2 | result |
| Data | 2 | 1 | 3 |
