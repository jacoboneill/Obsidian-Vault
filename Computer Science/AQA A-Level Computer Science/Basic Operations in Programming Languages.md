# Learning Objectives
- The correct syntax for writing basic programming code
- How to construct arithmetic operations, Boolean operations, and relational operations
- How to handle basic String operations
- How C++ and Python implement these operations

# Sections
- [[Arithmetic Operations]]
- [[Relational Operations]]
- [[Boolean Operations]]
- [[String Handling Functions]]
- [[Examples of Common Operations in Python and C++]]

# Tasks
- Write an example of a calculation using each of the arithmetic operators.
	- [[Examples of Arithmetic Operators]]
- What is the difference between a division of a `real` and the division of an `int`?
- Most calculations will get their values from variables. Why are variables used in programming rather than typing the raw values?
- Use examples to explain the difference between truncation and rounding.
- Why might random numbers be used?
- What is the difference between and `OR` statement and an `XOR` statement? Give an example.

- How can you get a substring from a string?
	- [[Getting a Substring From a String]]
- What formats can strings be converted to?
- Why are random numbers generated in programming languages not entirely random?
# Study / Research Tasks
- Write code for a calculator app that allows the user to enter one or more numbers and then carry out all the main arithmetic operations
	- [[Calculator]]
- Write code for an app that allows the user to input two numbers then carry out each of the relational operators returning an output of `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
	- [[Number Relator]]
- Write code for an app that extracts the vowels from the alphabet
