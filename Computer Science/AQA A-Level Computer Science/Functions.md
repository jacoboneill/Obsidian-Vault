# Functions
Functions are subroutines that return a value.
A function will take parameters and return a value typically based off of those parameters. For example, a calculator will take a number and when the *square root function key* is pressed, it will perform a square root function and return the result to the display.

# Benefits
- Some processes will take many lines of code but only produce one result. If this is separated from the main program it will make the code more readable.
- Reduces code by following the [[Clean Code Principles#DRY|DRY]] (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

# Functional Programming
Functional Programming is a method of programming that only uses functions see: ***here (chapters 46 and 47)*** #TODO
