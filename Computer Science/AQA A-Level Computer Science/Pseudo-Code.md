# Pseudo-Code
Pseudo-Code is a fake programming language used to not get bogged down in the intricacies of the high level programming languages syntax.
The only rule to pseudo-code is consistency. Don't use *"Save to File"* and then *"Write to File"* as this will confuse whoever is reading it.

## Example
```
SORT nameFile BY surname
```

is the same as

```
REPEAT
	COMPARE Adjacent values, SWAP If necessary
UNTIL No more swaps are needed
```

Just depends on what the developer prefers.
# Why is it useful
- Allows to structure code in the way the programmer will write it
- Converting pseudo-code into programming code can be found ***here (chapter 17)*** #TODO
