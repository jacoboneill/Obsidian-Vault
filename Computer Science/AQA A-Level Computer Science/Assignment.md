Assignments refer to setting data in addresses. For example:
```cpp
age = 15
```

Would set an address with a reference to `age` with the value of an unsigned integer of 24.

Therefore, say for example that `age` is stored at `0x2F` and an unsigned integer is 4 bits. Then address `0x2F` would contain the data `0xFF` (15 in hexadecimal).

Assignments happen all the time in computer science, and is the fundamental building blocks of low-level programming, as each operation is an assignment to an address to the CPU.
