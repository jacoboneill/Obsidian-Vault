# Specification Coverage
- 3.1.2.1 Programming Paradigms
- 3.1.2.3 Object Oriented Programming

# Learning Objectives
- The key principles and methods of object-oriented programming (OOP) including encapsulation, inheritance, instantiation, polymorphism, abstraction and overriding.
- That OOP programs are made up of classes and objects.
- That classes are a blueprint containing properties and methods.
- That objects are instances of a class containing the same properties and methods of the class.
- How to create class diagrams.

# Tasks
- In what way does OOP reflect the way things work in real life?
- Using a real-life example, define the following terms explaining the relationship between the three.
	- Class
	- Object
	- Inheritance
- Using the same real-life example, explain what properties and methods are.
- Draw a class diagram for your real life example.
	- [[Class Diagram Example]]
- How does encapsulation prevent side-effects?
- What are the two main ways to instantiate an object?
- Explain the difference between static, abstract, and virtual methods.
- Explain the difference between composition aggregation and association aggregation.
- What are polymorphism and overriding?
- What is an interface in the context of OOP?
- Explain the three main design principles for effective design.
# Study / Research Tasks
- For your real-life example above, use an OOP programming language to implement a solution. Include the following features:
	- Objects created using Abstract, Virtual, and Ttatic methods
	- Inheritance
	- Aggregation
	- Polymorphism
	- Public, Private, and Protected specifiers.
